# widgetSurvey
(Doesn't work yet)
An HTML page with external JS and CSS; attempt at form validation within a service satisfaction survey.

How it's supposed to work:
This is a form with radio buttons. If a question does not have a radio button selected when the user tries to submit, it should warn the user, and not complete the submit until all questions are answered.
