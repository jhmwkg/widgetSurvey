Web Widget - Service Survey Example

Since I'm learning how to code for the web, I thought I'd take
a stab on my own to replicate this common feature.

This item is not done. I will try to finish it in the future.

Aim is to have multiple questions with radio buttons, and
a text area, for user input. There will be input verification,
as follows: If all the radio button questions
have been checked, the submission will accept the input.
If any question is not checked, the submission will reject
the input and highlight (like make the question red) the missed
question.

I'm stuck on the verification. I have a feeling it will at least
require careful redesign of the classes, and a 'for' loop with
multiple nested 'ifs', in addition to some more research on
javascript form handling.
